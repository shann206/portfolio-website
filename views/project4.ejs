            <p class="text-center">This project is a simple but functional pizza ordering interface built with React, demonstrating
                component-based architecture, state management, and dynamic UI rendering.</p>

            <p>This project is a fully interactive Pizza Ordering Web App built with React. It features a dynamic menu
                system, real-time quantity tracking, and a functional shopping cart. The interface renders each pizza
                from structured data using reusable components, showcasing clean component-based architecture. Users can
                view available pizzas, check item availability, add items to the cart, and clear their cart at any time.
                Opening-hour logic automatically displays whether the restaurant is open based on the current time. The
                UI is styled with custom CSS and designed for responsiveness, creating a smooth and engaging ordering
                experience.</p>
            <p>The Pizza Menu app demonstrates the fundamentals of front-end development with React, focusing on
                component-based architecture, state management, and dynamic UI rendering.</p>
            <p>It includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic menu rendering from a structured data array</li>
                <li>Reusable React components (App, Menu, Pizza, Cart, Footer)</li>
                <li>State management with useState for cart contents and pizza quantities</li>
                <li>Add to cart functionality with alerts and quantity updates</li>
                <li>Cart system allowing users to view ordered items and clear the cart</li>
                <li>Conditional rendering to display store open/closed status based on current time</li>
                <li>Styling with CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This app uses React's component-driven approach and local state management to simulate a real-world pizza
                ordering interface, providing hands-on experience with dynamic UI updates, user interaction, and
                responsive design.</p>

            <p>What I Learned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to manage local and global state effectively with useState</li>
                <li>assing data and functions through props to coordinate component behavior</li>
                <li>Building reusable and maintainable UI components</li>
                <li>Handling user interactions and dynamic content updates</li>
            </ul>
